# meltmedia.com Redesign 2013

## I see website

We are redesigning our website. And we're doing it out in the open. This repo is public, so take a look around. We'll be committing updates on a regular basis and pushing frequent deployments. More info about that coming soon.

### Why are we doing it?

We're hoping it will be a learning experience for us as well as others. We'll be tracking each major step in our process and sharing our thoughts on what went well and what could have been better.
